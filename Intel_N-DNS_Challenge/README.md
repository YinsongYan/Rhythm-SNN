<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Rhythm-GSNN

This repository contains code to implement the Rhythm-GSNN model in our paper by incorporating the proposed rhythm mechanisms into the GSNN (i.e., [Spiking-FullSubNet](https://github.com/haoxiangsnr/spiking-fullsubnet), the winner of Intel N-DNS Challenge Track 1).
This repository includes:

- A PyTorch-based implementation of the Rhythm-GSNN model.
- Scripts for training the Rhythm-GSNN and evaluating its performance.

## **4. Model Training**


This section provides instructions on how to train models on various datasets using the provided scripts. Follow the steps below for each dataset:


### **1. PS-MNIST Dataset**
Run the following scripts for training on the PS-MNIST dataset, located in the `Spiking_pmnist` folder:
```
python main_psmnist-skipFFSNN.py # for Rhythm-FFSNN
python main_psmnist-skipASRNN.py # for Rhythm-ASRNN
``` 


### **2. S-MNIST Dataset**
Run the following scripts for training on the S-MNIST dataset, located in the `spiking_smnist` folder:
```
python main_seqmnist-skipFFSNN.py # for Rhythm-FFSNN
python main_seqmnist-skipASRNN.py # for Rhythm-ASRNN
``` 

### **3. SHD Dataset**
Run the following script for training on the SHD dataset, located in the `SHD` folder:
``` 
python main_dense_general_rhy.py # for Rhythm-DH-SFNN
``` 

### **4. ECG Dataset**
Run the following scripts for training on the ECG dataset, located in the `ECG` folder:
```
python main_ecg-skipFFSNN.py # for Rhythm-FFSNN
python main_ecg-skipASRNN.py # for Rhythm-ASRNN
```

### **5. DVS-Gesture Dataset**
Run the following scripts for training on the DVS-Gesture dataset, located in the `DVS-Gesture` folder:
```
python main_DVS-skipSRNN_general_cosA.py  # for Rhythm-FFSNN
python main_DVS-skipASRNN_general_cosA.py # for Rhythm-ASRNN
```

### **6. VoxCeleb1 Dataset**
Run the following script for training on the VoxCeleb1 dataset, located in the `VoxCeleb1` folder:
- `run_exp_spk.py`

Alternatively, you can use the shell script:
- `run_rhy_exp_spk.sh`

### **7. PTB Dataset**
Run the following scripts for training on the PTB dataset:
```
python RhythmSRNN-ptb.py # for Rhythm-SRNN
python RhythmALIF-ptb.py # for Rhythm-ASRNN
```

### 8. Intel N-DNS Challenge Dataset
The `Intel_N-DNS_Challenge` folder contains code to implement the Rhythm-GSNN model, as described in our paper, by incorporating the proposed rhythm mechanisms into the GSNN. This is based on [Spiking-FullSubNet](https://github.com/haoxiangsnr/spiking-fullsubnet), the winner of Intel N-DNS Challenge Track 1.

See the [Documentation](https://haoxiangsnr.github.io/spiking-fullsubnet/) for installation and usage.
